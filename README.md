# Showcase of Bosco Wong's Power BI projects

This repo stores my past Power BI projects (at work or personal).

1. Project Control Dashboard (personal project)

    - Dataset: private source
    - The project control dashboard reports the weekly progress and project-to-date progress of an on-going project. By comparing the man-hour planned and man-hour spent clustered by areas and disciplines, this dashboard allows project managers to keep track of the overall project progress as well as to allocate remaining manpower efficiently.

2. CoCreation Dashboard (working example)

    - Dataset: private source
    - The CoCreation dashboard was created during my work at a high school. This dashboard reports the outcome of the project which aims to boost student's online learning experience. Note that some data are transformed or deleted to avoid identifiable individuals.
